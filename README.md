# QZDH_Gaokao_Data: Gaokao Past Paper Reasoning Dataset
Chinese readme link is here: [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

QZDH_Gaokao_Data is a dataset independently collected by the Qizhi Navigation Project, aimed at promoting the rapid development of AI education, assisting in the development of AI applications, and the construction of AI teacher models. The original intention of the team in building this dataset is to provide data support for the fine-tuning of models used by the team, and it is hoped that everyone can take and use it as needed.

## Dataset Introduction
The QZDH_Gaokao_Data dataset covers many past papers from the Chinese Gaokao exams between 2010 and 2022, along with their large model answers. The dataset includes 675 question-answer pairs, mainly covering the two science subjects of mathematics and physics.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset contains a file named `Gaokao_R.json` in `./data/`, which includes the following fields:
- `"question"`: The markdown-formatted description of the question.
- `"answer"`: The answer provided by the large model.
- `"corr-ans"`: The standard official answer to the question.
- `"question_id"`: The ID identifier of the question.

## Dataset Processing Procedure
1. Question Collection: Obtain the 2010-2022 Gaokao past papers from the [Gaokao_Bench](https://github.com/OpenLMLab/GAOKAO-Bench) dataset.
2. Answer Generation: Use the [Deepseek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) large model to answer each question and obtain the generated answers.
3. Answer Verification: Compare the answers generated by Deepseek-R1 with the official standard answers and perform simple manual cleaning, following these standards:
    - Answers that are inconsistent are cleaned and deleted.
    - Consistent answers are retained.
    - Answers that are consistent but incorrectly formatted are formatted.
The specific procedures for data collection and preprocessing are demonstrated in the files located in `./src`.
